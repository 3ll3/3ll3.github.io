## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Our study seeks to elucidate the interactions
between common food compounds and
prescription medications.

### Markdown

Models:
- Baseline: random model with equal probability among 3
classes of interactions
- Sentiment analysis (Stanford model trained on movie
review corpus): classify interaction based on sentiment
- Bag of words with logistic regression: depends only on the
counts of each word (tf-idf) and the order of words is not
important
- Word embeddings with LSTM: pre-trained embedding
matrix from PubMed, dropout regularization
